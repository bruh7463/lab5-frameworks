## Overview
This project demonstrates three different front-end techniques:

1. **Bootstrap UI Layout**  
   - Navbar  
   - Two-column responsive grid  
   - Styled alert and button  
   - **Tool:** Bootstrap 5.3 via CDN  

2. **Tailwind CSS Responsive Card**  
   - Card with image, headline, call‑to‑action  
   - Fully responsive using utility classes (`bg-white`, `rounded`, `shadow`, etc.)  
   - **Tool:** Tailwind CSS via CDN  

3. **React.js Interactive Component**  
   - Functional component receiving a `name` prop  
   - Button toggles additional text with `useState`  
   - **Tool:** React (in CodeSandbox Starter)

## Tool Experience

- **Bootstrap 5.3**  
  Very quick to scaffold common UI elements. The grid and pre‑built components (navbar, alert, cards) allowed me to build a polished layout without writing custom CSS.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Utility‑first approach feels verbose at first but gives total control over spacing, colors, and responsiveness. Perfect for quickly iterating on a custom card design.

- **React**  
  React Starter from CodeSandbox made setup trivial. Using `useState` for toggling UI state demonstrates how easy it is to build interactive components with minimal boilerplate.
